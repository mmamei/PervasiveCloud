# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Since many have asked, I (the owner of the repo) want to clarify that it doesn't make sense to merge in and share everyone's template in one repo. Therefore, please **fork the repo and run it locally** if you wish to add your own templates for your development purpose. I will **only merge bug fixes and other updates** into the repo for the meantime.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You must test your code locally and make sure the build, the end-to-end testing, the tests are all working before submitting the PR. Otherwise we will simply reject it.
